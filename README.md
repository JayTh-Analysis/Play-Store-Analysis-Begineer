# Play-Store-Analysis-Begineer
This case study contains the analysis work done on the data gathered from Google Play Store to get some insights from it.
Using some basic understanding of Analysis with Python I have gathered some insights like-
1) Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps?
2) Does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
3) Do 'Teens' more likely provide rating during specific months of the year?
and more using visualizations like histogram, bar plot, scatter plot, box plot, etc. Also I have used Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Ploty etc.
